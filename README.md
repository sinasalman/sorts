# ðŸ“˜ Sort Algorithms

This program is designed for learning and utilizing sorting algorithms. If you have a C++ project and need to sort arrays, you can use **"sort.h"** and enjoy the provided methods! 

## ðŸ“‹ Available Algorithms
1. **Selection Sort**: `Selection_Sort(int array[], int size)`
2. **Bubble Sort**: `Bubble_sort(int array[], int size)`
3. **Insertion Sort**: `Insertion_sort(int array[], int size)`
4. **Quick Sort**: `Quick_sort(int array[], int low, int high)`

## ðŸ”§ Future Features
1. More algorithms will be added soon!
2. GUI will be added soon!
## ðŸ’¡ Why Use This Project?
- Simple and practical
- Suitable for C++ projects
- Learn and practice sorting algorithms
